I'm a PhD candidate in the Wilf Family Department of Politics and a member of the Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP) Lab at New York University. I earned a BS degree in mathematics from Fudan University and a MA degree in economics from Peking University before graduate school.

I'm interested in both political methodology and collective actions in non-democratic regimes. In particular, I develop and apply experimental/quasi-experimental tools to study the diffusion of protests in time and space, and how contentious politics interacts with electoral politics. My research also contributes to more transparent research designs by improving the practice of evaluating hypotheses and identification assumptions.

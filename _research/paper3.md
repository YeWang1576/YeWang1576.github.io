title: "Design-Based Inference for Spatial Experiments (with Peter Aronow and Cyrus Samii)"
collection: research
permalink: /research/paper3
excerpt: "We consider design-based causal inference in settings where randomized treatments have effects that bleed out into space in complex ways that overlap and in viola- tion of the standard “no interference” assumption for many causal inference methods. We define a spatial “marginalized individualistic response,” which characterizes how, on average, units of observation that are a specified distance from an intervention point are affected by treatments at that point, averaging over effects emanating from other intervention points. We establish conditions for non-parametric identification, non-parametric consistency, and consistent recovery of structural effects. We propose methods for both sample-theoretic and permutation-based inference."

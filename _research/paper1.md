title: "Revolution Not In My Backyard? Protest and Regime Support in an Electoral Autocracy (With Stan Wong)"
collection: working papers
permalink: /research/paper1
excerpt: "Contemporary revolutions are more likely to emerge from urban movements that involve participants of diverse socio-economic backgrounds. They are bound together by one common goal: overthrowing the authoritarian regime. The size of such a “negative coalition” plays a crucial role in determining the success or failure of the anti-regime movement, yet its formation process is not well investigated by social scientists. In this article, we examine how the exposure to protest led by the opposition shapes citizens’ attitude toward and support for the anti-regime camp. Analyzing the election outcomes at the polling-station level shortly after Hong Kong’s Umbrella Movement, we find that protest exposure, as measured by spatial proximity to protest sites, is positively correlated with the decline of electoral support for the opposition. We further find that the adverse cognitive impacts of protest exposure manifest themselves in elevating bystanding citizens’ sense of economic insecurity, even though the protest causes no persistent income loss and generally boosts political efficacy."
